- Carve your own path with a new branch (name this branch as your entry number) for your modifications,
  - that is:

    - check it out `git checkout entry-no` or
    - simply do `git checkout -b entry-no `
  - eg. `git branch 21becXXX`

- Blaze your trail with these commands:
  - `git add -A` or `git add .`

- Create a pull request.

- Wait for Pull Request to merge.

- Celebrate - you've done your first pull request!!

- ## 4. Here is a quick reference guide for GitHub: [GitHub Guide](https://github.com/git-guides)


- Aim to make more than 4 pull requests.
- Imagine you've only made 4 pull requests to different projects, but one of those projects isn't part of the Hacktoberfest event.
- In that case, your pull request won't be counted, leaving you with just 3 valid ones if those projects aren't excluded either.
- To ensure your success, I recommend making a pull request to your own repo, as long as it has the Hacktoberfest topic.
